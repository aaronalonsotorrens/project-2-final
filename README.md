# Super Mario Arcade

## Introduction

Welcome to my second project, part of the Code Institute Full Stack Development Course. The purpose of this project is to build a responsive website using HTML and CSS while incorporating interactive features with JavaScript.

Super Mario Arcade is an homage to one of the first games I played as a kid—my initial experience with coding without even realizing it. The site features two interactive games, along with a home page that lists the rules for each game.

The first game, titled "Tic-tac-yahoo," is a twist on classic tic-tac-toe, inspired by Mario's iconic victory shout. This is a two-player game where one player controls Mario and the other plays as Bowser, trying to stop Mario's quest to conquer the Mushroom Kingdom and rescue Princess Peach. Instead of traditional Xs and Os, the game uses images of Mario and Bowser, creating a more immersive experience. When a player achieves a winning combination, a unique victory message appears, along with a button to restart the game. If neither player wins, the game ends in a draw, and a restart button will also appear to allow players to start again.

The second game is "Mario Shadow Quest," a guessing game that tests players' knowledge of the many characters in the Mario Universe. Players earn a point for each correct guess, and with every correct answer, a new image is randomly selected. Each image has both correct and incorrect answers. A timer limits gameplay, and once time is up, a restart button appears, giving players the option to play again.

Users can easily navigate through the website using a functional navigation bar. This allows them to return to the home page to review the rules of the games or switch between games seamlessly.

Thank you for visiting Super Mario Arcade!

## UX - User Experience Design

The 5 planes of UX are the following:

- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

### The Strategy Plane

1. Creator Goals

- As a creator, I want a webpage to be easy to naviagte.

- As a creator, I want the webpage to be user-friendly, responsive and interactive.

- I want to evoke a nostalgic, childhood-like feeling for users by designing a space that brings back memories through carefully curated CSS and engaging games.

- I aimed to create a minimum of two games: one as a 2-player game to enjoy with friends and family members, and a second game designed for solo play, allowing users to challenge themselves individually.

2. User stories

- As a user, I want to navigate easily through the different sections of the webpage.

- As a user, I want clear guidelines on how the game works, including it's objectives, rules, and other essential details.

- As a user, I want the games to perform well, with responsive and interactive buttons, to provide an enjoyable experience.

- As a user, I expect the game to work smoothly on all devices.

### The Scope Plane.

For this website, I focused on implementing key features within a limited timeframe. Some additional features I had planned were not included due to time constraints.

**Features implemented upon webpage release**

- A functional navigation bar which allows the user to naviagte through the website with ease.

- A home page that includes the rules for each game. The rules are hidden behind a button to avoid overwhelming users when they first arrive with excesive text.

- A tic-tac-toe game featuring images of Mario and Bowser instead of the typical circles and crosses, offering a more immersive "Marioverse" experience.

- A visual quiz game where users test their knowledge of the diverse range of Mario characters.

- Footer with links to social media.

### The Scope plane

**Colors**

The following are the list of colours used in this project.

- Color #2CB01A

Color of the background in the navigation bar. Color of background for description and rules of game 1.

- Color #red

Color of the background in the footer.

- Color #white

Color of the background and text within the navigation bar where each game is contained to provide a higher contrast.

- Color #black

Color of the text.

- Color #yellow

Color of the restart button in the tic-tac-yahoo game.

- Color #goldenrod

Color of the background for description and rules of game 2.

**Fonts**

The fonts used in this project are from Google Fonts.

Font

- I used "Lilita One" as the main font, as it's a user friendly font. The "Lilita One" font is distinctive bold and highly legible. I believe the chunky and rounded letterforms convey a fun and frienly appearence ideal for a Super Mario Arcade game.

**Images**

Images downloaded for this project are from:

- Vecteezy

### The Skeleton Plane

As I progressed with the project, some ideas evolved further while others were set aside.

Header wireframes
--------------------
- The navigation bar includes the website logo and navigation links that guide the user to each game, making the website more user-friendly.
- The navigation bar color matches the iconic green of Mario’s emblematic pipes.
- Navigation elements are hidden behind a toggle menu across all devices.
- The title "Super Mario Arcade" functions as a home button, returning the user to the home page when clicked, a feature commonly expected on modern websites.

Home page
--------------------
- The index or "Home" page contains the rules for each game available on the website.
- It includes a description of each game, along with the objective and instructions on how to play.
- Rules are hidden behind an interactive button that, when clicked, reveals the content. This helps prevent visual clutter and avoids overwhelming users visiting the site.
- Within each description box there is a play button that directs the user directly to the game of interest for a better user experience.

Tic-tac-yahoo page
--------------------
- Tic-tac-yahoo is a 2-player game.
- The tic-tac-yahoo page contains a 3x3 grid where the game takes place.
- Below the grid a sentence indicates which player goes first.
- Circles and crosses have been replaced with images of Mario and Bowser to immerse players further into the game’s theme.
- When either player wins, a specific message appears, along with an option to restart the game. 
- If the game ends in a draw, a restart button will appear, allowing players to play again.

Mario Shadow Quest page
--------------------
- TMario Shadow Quest displays a box containing the silhouette of a Mario character.
- A new, random character silhouette appears each time the player clicks on an option.
- Below the image there are two options with only one of the being the correct option.
- A score section tracks the number of correct and incorrect answers.
- A highest score section that keeps track of the highest score recorded.

#### Bugs and Fixes

1. The restart button in "Tic-tac-yahoo" was particularly challenging, as I wanted to clear the board without simply refreshing the page. I tried multiple approaches, but either the board wouldn’t clear, or the restart button wouldn’t function properly.

- This was resolved by creating a new empty string for each square, then calling back the function to generate a new board, which successfully addressed the issue.

2. In "Mario shadow quest", there were a few bugs where images wouldn’t change after an option was selected, sometimes causing the image to remain static. Additionally, there were styling issues with image alignment across different devices.

- The first issue was resolved by adjusting the image loading time; initially, it was set too high, causing clicks to outpace the image load time.
- The styling issue was resolved thanks to my mentor's advice to set a specific width for the images and apply left and right margins set to auto, ensuring images always stayed centered.

### Deployment

The master branch of this repository is the most current version and has been used for the deployed version of the site.

- Open your project on github and go to settings.
- Proceed and click on pages and change branch to main.
- Once this has been done the project will have been deployed.
