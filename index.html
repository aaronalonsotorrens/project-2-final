        <h3>Tic-tac-Yahooo (2 Players)</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to the Mario vs. Bowser Tic-Tac-Yahoooo Showdown! In this
          exciting twist on the classic game, Mario and Bowser face off for
          ultimate control over the Mushroom Kingdom!

        <h4>How to Play:</h4>
        <ol class="rules-game1-list">
          <li>
            Players:
            <ul class="player-list">
              <li>Player 1 is represented by Mario</li>
              <li>Player 2 is represented by Bowser</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Objective:
            <p>
              The goal is to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or
              diagonally using your character (Mario or Bowser). The first
              player to achieve this wins the game!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Game Board:
            <p>
              The Tic-Tac-Toe board is a 3x3 grid, just like the traditional
              version. However, instead of using circles (O) and crosses (X),
              Player 1 will place Mario's image in a square, and Player 2 will
              place Bowser's image in their chosen square.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn Sequence:
            <ul class="turn-sequence-list">
              <li>
                Player 1 (Mario) goes first and selects a square to place
                Mario's image.
              </li>
              <li>
                Player 2 (Bowser) then chooses a different square to place
                Bowser's image.
              </li>
              <li>
                The game alternates between players until one player gets three
                of their images in a row or the board is full.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Winning the Game:
            <ul class="winning-rules">
              <li>
                If a player gets three Mario or three Bowser images in a
                straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), they win!
              </li>
              <li>
                If all squares are filled and no one has three in a row, it's a
                draw.
              </li>

              As you adventure through this game, you'll see mysterious
              silhouettes of Mario and his pals! But here's the twist - you only
              get two options to guess who it is. Choose wisely and collect as
              many points as you can before the time runs out.

              You've got just 10 seconds per question! Time flies faster than a
