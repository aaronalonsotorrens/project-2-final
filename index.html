            <h4>How to Play:</h4>
            <ol class="rules-game1-list">
                <li>Players:
                    <ul class="player-list">
                        <li>Player 1 is represented by Mario</li>
                        <li>Player 2 is represented by Bowser</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Objective:
                    <p>The goal is to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally using your character (Mario or Bowser). The first player to achieve this wins the game!</p>
                </li>
                <li>Game Board:
                    <p>The Tic-Tac-Toe board is a 3x3 grid, just like the traditional version. However, instead of using circles (O) and crosses (X), Player 1 will place Mario's image in a square, and Player 2 will place Bowser's image in their chosen square.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Turn Sequence:
                    <ul class="turn-sequence-list">
                        <li>Player 1 (Mario) goes first and selects a square to place Mario's image.</li>
                        <li>Player 2 (Bowser) then chooses a different square to place Bowser's image.</li>
                        <li>The game alternates between players until one player gets three of their images in a row or the board is full.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Winning the Game:
                    <ul class="winning-rules">
                        <li>If a player gets three Mario or three Bowser images in a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), they win!</li>
                        <li>If all squares are filled and no one has three in a row, it's a draw.</li>
                    </ul>
